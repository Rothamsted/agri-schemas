The last four crops did not receive any fertilizer or manure. Winter wheat was grown continuously, apart from occasional fallowing to control weeds. The experiment was divided into different Strips or 'Plots' (0 - 20) receiving the different fertilizer and manure treatments each year. Most treatment strips were established by 1852, except for strip 2A, which began in 1885, and strip 20, which began in 1906. Between 1894 and 1925 many plots were harvested in two halves, Top (T) and Bottom (B), equivalent to the Western and Eastern parts of the experiment.";

	  "Note 1, Harvesting\nFrom 1844 to 1901 the wheat crop was cut by hand by scythes, from 1902 to 1956 a self-binder was used, originally horse drawn, and then powered by a tractor. Hand cutting with scythes was often necessary if the ground was very wet or the crop was badly lodged (flattened). After cutting the crop was bound into sheaves which were ‘stooked’ and left on the plot for about two weeks then ‘carted’ into barns where they were threshed over the winter. Cutting and carting may have been spread over several days. Thus the earlier datasets BBKYIELD and BBKYIELD_F include the dates of both cutting and carting the crop. From 1957 the plots have been harvested by a small plot combine harvester; only the central strip of each plot is taken for yield and samples. Before 1957 the plots were usually cut in early August, since 1957 combining has been in August or early September. Sowing and harvest dates are available from the e-RA Curators.",
		"Note 2, Plot areas\nWhen the experiment was established in 1843 most of the plots were very large. Most comprised an ‘a’ and ‘b’ half (each 3.77m wide) and were 320m long (the length of the field). Plots 21 and 22 are a little narrower. In 1894 the two halves were combined, giving a total plot area of 0.24ha. As the experiment progressed these large plots have been subdivided into different Sections (see ‘Background’ for more details), with corresponding changes in the area harvested. The current plot lengths vary depending on the Section and are between 15.24m (Section 0) and 28.04m (Section 1). The plots are now 6m wide (except plots 21 and 22 which are 4m wide) with 48 rows at 12.5 cm spacing. The harvested area is 2.1m wide. The harvested area is shown in most of the datasets."
