	dc:title "A transcriptional map following the developmental trajectory of the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage";
	schema:description "Developmental transitions can be described in terms of morphology and individual genes expression patterns, but also in terms of global transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Most of the large-scale studies of such transitions, however, have only been possible in synchronized cell culture systems. Here we generate a cell type specific transcriptome of an adult stem-cell lineage in the Arabidopsis leaf using RNA sequencing and microarrays. RNA profiles of stomatal entry, commitment, and differentiating cells, as well as of mature stomata and the entire aerial epidermis give a comprehensive view of the developmental progression. To obtain pure cell populations corresponding to different stomatal lineage cell types we used Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) in combination with markers of early (SPCHp::SPCH-YFP, SSY), middle (MUTEp::nucGFP, MG), and late (FAMAp::GFP-FAMA, FGF) precursor stages, as well of mature stomata (enhancer trap E1728::GFP, E1728G) and a marker of the entire epidermis (ML1p::YFP-RCI2A, ML1Y). To minimize transcriptional differences due to age, all cell types were sorted from 10-day old aerial rosettes, and the specificity of expression pattern at this common time point confirmed via confocal microscopy. Total RNA was extracted from purified protoplasts (4,000 to 20,000 cells/replicate; 2 replicates/marker line; 3 replicates/SSY marker line) and transcript abundance measured using RNA sequencing.";

	dc:title "RNA-seq Analysis of an Apical Meristem Time Series Reveals a Critical Point in Arabidopsis thaliana Flower Initiation";
	schema:description "Floral transition is a critical event in the life cycle of a flowering plant as it determines its reproductive success. Despite extensive studies of specific genes that regulate this process, the global changes in transcript expression profiles at the point when a vegetative meristem transitions into an inflorescence have not been described. In this study we analyzed gene expression during Arabidopsis thaliana meristem development from day 7 to 16 after germination in one-day increments. The dynamics of the expression of the main flowering regulators were consistent with previous reports: notably, the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) decreased over the course of the time series while expression of LEAFY (LFY) increased. This analysis revealed a developmental time point between 10 and 12 days after germination where FLC expression had decreased but LFY expression had not yet increased, which was characterized by a peak in the number of differentially expressed genes. GO enrichment analysis of these genes identified an overrepresentation of genes related to the cell cycle, suggesting that during transition to the flowering stage a change in dynamics of cell division takes place. In particular, we hypothesize that a subset of the meristematic cells experiences a forced exit from G0 at day 10. Finally, we observed an acceleration of the cell cycle at day 11, which may be linked to meristem reorganization preceding activation of LFY.";
