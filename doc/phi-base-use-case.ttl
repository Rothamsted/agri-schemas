# This is the container that glue things together, based on PHIBase records.
#
# Host-pathogen interactions are a specific case of process, action, or alike
# We use schema:Action for that. This is somewhat close, not ideal, to what we mean, since 
# schema actions seem specific to human actions (eg, agent is restricted to Organization or Person).
# 
# Probably it requires some other kind of process/action, or a better definition of the existing Action.
# Bioschemas doesn't seem to have any mention of these concepts
#
# Clearly, this is relevant in the defition of pathways too (see the biomolecular use case).

# schema:Action can be redundantly added, to ease consumers like Google
