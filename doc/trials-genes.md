# Modelling links between field trials, markers, genotypes, phenotypes, cultivars

## EBI gene Expression Atlas

We have drafted a [modelling example](ebi-gxa-use-case/README.md) of data coming from the 
[EBI Gene Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa), which contains NGS and microarray 
experiments and reports computed results about differentially expressed genes (eg, computed via 
ANOVA) or sequence counts (eg, using TPM).  

While there aren't many agriculture-related experiments in GXA, it provides data that are easy to compare across experiments and are associated to experiment and sample metadata.
