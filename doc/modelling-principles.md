# General Modelling Principles

The modelling in AgriSchemas is being based on the following principles.

**==> We have added many more while [working on MIAPPE](miappe-use-case/dataset-arabidopsis/README.md).**

## Leverage primarily on schema.org and bioschemas 

New classes and properties should be based on these lightweight ontologies. When a type in them is good enough for our use case, use it directly. We also recommend the following principles about these two references:

  * Possibly, use the same [profiling principle](https://bioschemas.gitbook.io/training-portal/) used in bioschemas.  

  * Use constructs like [domainIncludes](https://schema.org/domainIncludes) and [rangeIncludes](https://schema.org/rangeIncludes) to define new types. This is lighter/simpler than OWL (can be possibly converted to OWL statements) and fits into the schema/bioschemas model.  

  * Don't use `owl:datatypeProperty/owl:objectProperty`. All schema.org properties are simple instances of `rdf:Property`. In our files, we instantiate `owl:AnnotationProperty` too, but just for the practical reason that Proteg√© doesn't see anything that isn't under the OWL vocabulary.  

  * The above also allows you to use properties and classes in a simple way. For instance, the
  values for the property `agri:accession` can be either a simple string (eg, `"GO:00000297"`), 
  or a [`StructuredValue`](https://schema.org/StructuredValue), which is able to further eference 
  elements like an [`url`](https://schema.org/url)
  or [`dc:source`](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/source) (which also avoids us to be concerned 
  of the distinction between [dc: and dc:terms](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47519315)).  

  * Before considering using more comples types, use the simplest/more general. For instance, an 
  [`additionalType`](https://schema.org/additionalType) attached to a [biological sample](https://bioschemas.org/types/Sample/) resource is usually enough to say which organisms the sample is instance of. Similarly, a [`PropertyValue`](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) instance might be good to track very dataset-specific properties (eg, see the [PHI-base use case](drafts/201904-dfw-hackathon/phi-base-use-case.ttl)).

  * Use `dc:type` when you don't want a stronger commitment (eg, `rdf:type`, `owl:equivalentProperty`). In particular, when a property (eg score) is related to something that is defined as an OWL class, and has a similar or same meaning (`obo:OBI_0000071`), link the two with this less formal schema property.



## List of additional preferred schemas/ontologies

Try to reuse existing types as much as possible. When you feel you need a new definition, use schema or bischemas, as said above. When your use case don't fit in them, try the following common schemes/ontologies (in the listed order), before creating a new definition: 

* Dublin Core Elements (as said above, we don't quite need terms)
* RDF-S
* SKOS (but first consider [DefinedTerm](https://schema.org/DefinedTerm) and see the discussion about term annotations).
* [Annotation Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/)

When introducing a new term, try as much as possible to find appropriate existing terms to extend 
(`rdfs:subClassOf/rdfs:subPropertyOf`). If a new term is defined, try to provide minimal mapping 
to external ontologies (eg, [SIO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/SIO)). We say 
"minimal" because furter mappings should go in separated files and addressed after initial 
modelling.  

The best ways to refer an external term are `rdfs:subClassOf`, `rdfs:subPropertyOf` 
(beware they require a strong formal commitment),  `dc:type` (when there is a more 
informal link, eg, between [`bioschema:LabProtocol`](http://bioschemas.org/LabProtocol) and 
[`obi:protocol`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000272)) or `rdfs:seeAlso` (for cross-type 
links and similarly informal relations, eg, see `agri:isBiologicallyRelatedTo` in [agri-schema definitions](drafts/201904-dfw-hackathon/agri-schema.ttl), linked 
to [sio:association](http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000897))

## Markers for proposed new types and MIREOT-style importing

Types marked as `agri:AgriSchemasImported***` will automatically imported following the [MIREOT methodology][10]. See [agri-schema definitions](agri-schema.ttl).
